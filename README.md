## Inspiration
Our team really resonated with Aritzia’s philosophy and approach which are 1. Women empowering women, and 2. Sustainability. We wanted to find innovative solutions to enhance the user experience in ways that follow Aritzia’s existing values. HerVision is an extension on the Aritzia shopping app that focuses on 2 main features. The first feature includes your own personal wardrobe where you can keep track of your timeless pieces and pair them together to create outfits. Can’t think of an outfit? We’ve got you covered! The second feature is a welcoming community for all Aritzia lovers to show their favorite pieces through an aesthetic and easy to use platform offered right in the Aritzia app. During our brainstorming process, we researched why TikTok is the number one way to market products and we found 2 ways, its quick and easy to use which makes it almost addicting to scroll through. We wanted to implement this into our program which is why we made HerVision solely for pictures. We also liked this approach of building an in-app community because it is accessible globally which will expand Aritzia’s market. Another community feature for a make-up company already has over 5.5 million users.

## What it does
HerVision is a mobile app that is built with Aritizia’s values of 
It helps Aritzia customers build their personal style by allowing them to add pieces to their Wardrobe.In their Wardrobe they can choose a piece and see it paired with another piece. Essentially, they can add a top to their Wardrobe and see how it looks with a selection of different bottoms and vice versa. The app also features an Explore page where users can upload pictures of their own The idea here is to feel empowered by sharing your creativity with the Aritzia community. Users who are seeking to build their style can come to this page to be inspired by their community. On the explore page, users can search for images including specific items that they want to see, as well.

## Challenges we ran into
We wanted to create an iOS app, but most of were unfamiliar with Swift. We faced challenges with required software needed (eg XCode).
This was the first hackathon all of us had participated in, and we did not realize what a time crunch it would be. We were very excited to have a number of features in our app. However, we quickly realized this was going to be difficult. Since we are still learning Swift, we decided to narrow down our scope about halfway through as we felt we had too much on our plate. Though we were upset to let go of features we were excited about, we eventually realized we needed to prioritize a smaller number of features so we could have a minimal viable product.

## What we learned
We learned about how to create an iOS app using Swift and XCode. We also learned about using Git and GitHub for collaboration purposes. Since we have mostly worked individually in the past, we learned how to divide work in a team when it comes to programming.

## Accomplishments were proud of 
Making an app that is promoting sustainability focusing on the long lasting quality of aritzia products We learned a new programming language that was fit for creating an app and explored code snippets and ideas as team and helped each other. Overall, we’re all really proud to have participated in our first hackathon and created a product in such a short time!

## Whats next 
Our next step would be to incorporate ML into this program. We are currently considering how we could create an algorithm that learns about a user’s preferences (based on their Wardrobe, interactions, etc.) and then creates an Explore page for them that is more likely to include outfits that they would actually like.We would also like to expand upon the community aspect of the app by allowing users to make accounts so that they can interact with each others’ outfit posts (e.g. through likes and comments). To make a coherent e-commerce experience, we would also link these accounts to the existing ones on the Aritzia website, so you can add to your cart and wishlist both in HerVision and on the Aritzia website.

- Machine learning, recommending users outfits based on similar interests with other users. (data science)
